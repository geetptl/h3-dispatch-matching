# Dispatch Matching Application

### Made with python, flask, postgres, h3, docker, openstreetmap and love ‚ù§Ô∏è

## How to run

_One docker image a day, keeps configuration headache away._

### Compose Up

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

This creates a stack of two containers.

1. Container `postgres` runs the database with `postgis` and `h3` enabled on it.
   + `h3` is uber's open source geospatial indexing system. Documentation is available [here](https://h3geo.org/).
   + To use `h3` as a part of `postgres`, we use `h3-pg` package, which is available [here](https://github.com/zachasme/h3-pg). Thank you [Zacharias](https://github.com/zachasme) for making this!
   + [This dockerfile](./postgres/Dockerfile) takes care of installation such that the end product is a running database!
2. Container `python` runs a flask application which contains the APIs.

### Usage

Open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000/) to verify the status of the application container. Go to the status page to check the status of the database container. It might take a few moments for the database container to become running and reachable.

When writing this, only this setup has been completed. Actual dispatch matching APIs are under construction üõ†Ô∏è, but come back soon!

### Compose Down

```shell
docker compose down --rmi local -v
```

This takes down the container stack, removes the network, local images and volumes.
